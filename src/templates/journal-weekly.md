## This week’s goal

Get a **working, boring, low-power baseline** in place without disappearing into optimisation rabbit holes.

No dashboards. No clustering. Just something that stays on.

## What I actually did

- Picked hardware I already owned instead of “ideal” hardware
- Installed the host OS and verified idle power draw
- Set up basic SSH access and backups
- Resisted the urge to virtualise everything immediately

Nothing fancy. Everything intentional.

## What broke (or nearly did)

I went down a brief “maybe I should…” spiral:
- Maybe ZFS?
- Maybe Proxmox straight away?
- Maybe dual NIC bonding?

All technically valid. All unnecessary *right now*.

I stopped before complexity won.

## What I’m keeping

- One machine
- One OS
- One clear job

This setup survives reboots, updates, and distractions — which is the real test.

## SmallGrid takeaway

If your homelab needs a diagram to explain, it’s probably too complicated for week one.
