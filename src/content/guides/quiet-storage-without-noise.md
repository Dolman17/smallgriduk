## The enemy: vibration and heat
Fans are loud because something is hot. Drives are loud because they vibrate.

## Simple wins
- Put the box on something that absorbs vibration (rubber feet / foam pad)
- Prefer fewer, larger drives (within reason)
- Keep airflow clear so fans stay slow

## External storage options
- USB HDD enclosure (cheap + simple)
- DAS box (multi-bay external storage)
- NAS (if you want network storage)

## SmallGrid rule
If the storage upgrade makes you dread being in the same room as your server, it’s not an upgrade.
