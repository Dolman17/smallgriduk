## 3-2-1 in one minute
- **3 copies** of your data
- **2 different media** (e.g., disk + cloud, or disk + NAS)
- **1 offsite** (not in the same building)

## The SmallGrid version (practical)
- Primary data on your server/NAS
- Local backup to a USB disk (nightly)
- Offsite backup monthly (cloud or a rotated drive stored elsewhere)

## The only rule that matters
If you’ve never restored from it, it isn’t a backup. It’s a hope.
